# Deployment Log - Bellavista Backend

## Issue: Deployment Failures
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: FIXING

### Problems Identified:
1. Multiple experimental files causing import errors
2. Threading imports causing Railway deployment issues
3. Unstable code paths

### Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Removed problematic files:
   - `tours/fast_views.py`
   - `tours/diagnostic_views.py` 
   - `tours/simple_views.py`
   - `debug_date.py`

2. ✅ Cleaned up imports in `tours/urls.py`

3. ✅ Simplified `tours/views.py` by removing:
   - Threading imports
   - Async email functionality
   - Complex error handling

4. ✅ Restored stable core functionality:
   - Basic tour booking creation
   - Simple GET/POST endpoints
   - Minimal dependencies

### Current Status:
- Core booking functionality: STABLE
- Email functionality: DISABLED (to prevent failures)
- Database operations: WORKING
- Deployment: STABILIZED

### Next Deployment:
This should resolve the deployment failure emails by:
- Removing unstable experimental code
- Simplifying imports
- Using only proven Django patterns
