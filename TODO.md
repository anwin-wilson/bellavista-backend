# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Tasks
- [x] Update railway.json with proper port binding and production environment variables
- [x] Add SPA fallback URL pattern in bellavista_backend/urls.py for non-API routes
- [x] Create basic index.html in staticfiles for frontend SPA
- [x] Update TEMPLATES DIRS to include staticfiles for template loading
- [x] Production testing completed - API endpoints still returning HTML instead of JSON

## Status
- Stats endpoint already fixed (uses 'visited' status)
- DEBUG already defaults to False in settings.py
- Railway deployment is still serving React frontend for all routes including /api/*
- The fixes were not applied or Railway hasn't redeployed yet

## Test Results
- All API endpoints (/api/tours/test/, /api/tours/stats/, etc.) return React HTML instead of JSON
- Root URL also returns React HTML
- Indicates Railway is still serving static files instead of Django app
